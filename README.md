# NonLinearLeastSquaresSolver
This is a exercise implementation of non-linear least squares solver . It now contains Gauss-Newton and robust cost function  implementation . The robust cost function uses Cauchy Loss function. 

This repository will continue update next. In the future, the implementation of LM algorithm and Dogleg algorithm will be added.
